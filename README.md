# Mapping_Earthquakes

Using JavaScript and APIs to map earthquakes 

## Project Overview

Mapping the earthquakes was accomplished using the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) - this populated a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL.

## Challenge Overview

1. Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file
2. Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps
3. Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
4. Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls
5. Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
6. Render maps on a local server.
